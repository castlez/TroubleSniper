							Jonathan Castle
Prerequesites:
	This was originally developed in Visual Studio 15, though it could work with older
	versions. 

To add a mini-app to TroubleSniper, you must follow these steps(IN YOUR OWN FORK):

	1. Add mini-app project to the main TroubleSniper directory.
	2. Add a reference to that project in the TroubleSniper_Main project. 
	3. In the TroubleSniper_Main project, add a button, description, and onclick
	   handler for the new mini-app (refer to existing mini-apps for reference)
	4. Update README with information about the mini-appI
	5. Submit a pull request to the authors version
