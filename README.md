## Description
TroubleSniper is a trouble shooting application for windows 10 with a focus on finding problems with 
video games. 


### How to launch & Use
Locate the executable file called "TroubleSniper.exe" in the main directory (TroubleSniper). Upon launching
the application, you will see a series of diagnostic mini-apps that can be launch simultaneously. These mini-
apps each track a specific activity on your computer and report information about that activity to assist in 
finding causes of, and solutions to, the problem.


## Current Mini-Apps

changing focus. Common problems this can help with include a random focus change to desktop when trying to play a game.
